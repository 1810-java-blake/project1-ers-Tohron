* --------------------------- Make IDs auto-incrementing (Done on reimbursements?)
* (Done?) Finalize list retrieval methods
* Can send reimbursement lists in response to Employee and (filtered) Finance GET requests
* (Done?) Finalize reimbursement creation & update methods
* Can respond to creation & update POST requests (with confirmation of success/failure)
* (WIP) Can respond to login POST request (with confirmation of success/failure)
* (WIP) Create .sql file for automatically creating relevant tables and filling them with info

* Format (non-React) pages for login, employee, and finance (employee has fields, buttons for new, finance has dropdown filter & approve/deny buttons)
* Login button forwards to employee or finance (based on selected dropdown option)
* (WIP) Login uses required fields, and sends POST request
* (WIP) Employee and finance servlets check for logged-in session
* Employee and finance tables are automatically filled with reimbursement data

* Selecting row in Employee table fills side fields with all reimbursement data
* Selecting row in Finance table enables approve & reject buttons
* Employee can add a new reimbursement request (blanks fields, enables buttons to confirm & cancel) (this updates the table)
* Finance can filter requests by status (this updates the table)
* Finance can use approve & reject functionality (this updates the table)

Can servlet notify client of updates: Would need sockets - could just use periodic GET
In which cases is session ID preserved: Session ID is tied to browser window
Presentations are on Monday
